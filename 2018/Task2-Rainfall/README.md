# Task 2: Rainfall

Barbeques are almost guaranteed to bring out the rain.

You need to pick a good day, so you've had a look at the rainfall records for around here. They're listed in the 02-rainfall.txt file, with one record per line.

The trouble is, the rainfall sensor isn't that reliable and keeps generating data after you've told it not to. You've marked the limit of the valid answers with the sentinel value `9999`. All the values up to, but not including, the sentinel are the rainfall numbers you're after. You should ignore `9999` and all the values afterwards.

For example, your rainfall records could look like this:

8  
6  
7  
14  
0  
10  
9  
9999  
12  
4  
6  
19  
6  
14  

You can assume all the values are positive integers, and there are no blank lines or comment lines in the file.

Part 1

Given the rainfall records in 02-rainfall.txt, how many valid rainfall records have you got?

In the sample data above, there are seven valid records, from 8 to 9.

Part 2

The rainfall records are still in 02-rainfall.txt; what is the average (mean) of the valid rainfall records? Give your answer to the nearest whole number. 

In the sample data above, there are seven valid records with a total of 54, so the average is 54 / 7 = 7.71, rounding to 8.
