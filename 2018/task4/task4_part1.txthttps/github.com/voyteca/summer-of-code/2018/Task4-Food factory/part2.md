You've realised that sorting everything out on your own is impractical, and you need help to get things finished on time. The good news is that you've recruited a lot of friends to help you; so many, in fact, that your pool of helpers is effectively unlimited. This means that you can have several tasks being worked on at the same time.

In the example above, the tasks quesadilla and parsnip can be done straight away, but you can't start tuna until porter has been done, and you can't start porter until both quesadilla and barley have been completed. kingfish requires three tasks to be finished before you can start it.

You can draw up the dependency network between the tasks, and it will look something like this:

A network of tasks and dependencies

In this case, three people can start work on quesadilla, parsnip and barley at the same time. After 18 minutes, quesadilla is finished and someone can start work on linguine. After 20 minutes, barley is done and someone else can start work on porter. After 38 minutes, kingfish can start. It will take 64 minutes for you and your friends to complete the lot. 

Part 2
The instructions are still in 04-preparation.txt. With unlimited help, how long will it take to complete all the tasks?
